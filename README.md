# Overview

This project is a simple **To-Do List API** built with Node.js and Express. It demonstrates key backend development concepts such as routing, middleware, recursion, exception handling, and integration with third-party libraries.

The goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of backend software engineering principles, practice writing modular and maintainable code, and demonstrate my ability to build RESTful APIs.

# Development Environment

- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Package Manager:** npm
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
  - **Express** – Web framework for building the API
  - **UUID** – For generating unique identifiers for to-do's
  - **Nodemon** – For automatic server restarts during development

This project was developed entirely in **JavaScript (Node.js)** using **CommonJS modules** for modularity.

The app is run in a Node.js environment and demonstrates:

- ES6+ array methods (`filter`)
- Recursion for counting todos
- RESTful API structure with Express
- Basic error handling with `try/catch`
- Clean project organization using separate route, utility, and data files
